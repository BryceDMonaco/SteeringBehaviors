# SteeringBehaviors
A repo to prototype steering behaviors in Unity for AI, implementing C# versions of algorithms originally written for Flash from [here](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/series/understanding-steering-behaviors--gamedev-12732), which themselves are based off of steering behaviors designed originally by Craig Reynolds. I plan to use what I build in this repo in future projects.
